# React Chat App

This project is a simple, real-time chat application built using React. The application allows users to enter a chat room, set their username, and start sending messages. Each message is displayed with the sender's username and the time it was sent.

- Usernames: When a user first visits the chat room, they're asked to enter a username. This username is stored in the local storage, so it persists even if the user refreshes the page.

- Real-time chat: Users can type messages in an input box and see them appear in real time in the message list. Each message includes the sender's username and the time it was sent.

- React and local state: The application is built using React and uses local state to manage the usernames and messages. This makes it a great project for learning about React, state management, and real-time updates.
